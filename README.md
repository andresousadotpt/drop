# Drop

[Drop](https://drop.andresousa.pt): local file and text sharing in your browser. Inspired by Apple's Airdrop.

#### Drop is built with the following technologies:

-   [React](https://react.dev/) front-end
-   Websocket Golang back-end

You can [host your own app with Docker](/docs/dev.md).
